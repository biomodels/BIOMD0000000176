# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Increased glycolytic flux as an outcome of whole-genome duplication in yeast.**   
Conant GC, Wolfe KH _Mol. Syst. Biol._ [2007 ; Volume: 3 (Issue: )]: 129
[17667951](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17667951) ,  
**Abstract:**   
After whole-genome duplication (WGD), deletions return most loci to single
copy. However, duplicate loci may survive through selection for increased
dosage. Here, we show how the WGD increased copy number of some glycolytic
genes could have conferred an almost immediate selective advantage to an
ancestor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, providing a rationale for the success of
the WGD. We propose that the loss of other redundant genes throughout the
genome resulted in incremental dosage increases for the surviving duplicated
glycolytic genes. This increase gave post-WGD yeasts a growth advantage
through rapid glucose fermentation; one of this lineage's many adaptations to
glucose-rich environments. Our hypothesis is supported by data from enzyme
kinetics and comparative genomics. Because changes in gene dosage follow
directly from post-WGD deletions, dosage selection can confer an almost
instantaneous benefit after WGD, unlike neofunctionalization or
subfunctionalization, which require specific mutations. We also show
theoretically that increased fermentative capacity is of greatest advantage
when glucose resources are both large and dense, an observation potentially
related to the appearance of angiosperms around the time of WGD.

  
  

The original model submitted by the authors was slightly altered and now
comprises the models originally submitted as MODEL2426780967, MODEL2427021978,
MODEL2427095802. It reproduces figures 2A,3A and 3B from the publication.

This model uses the glycolysis model from Pritchard and Kell (2002) with an
additional parameter, **WGD_E** , to adjust for the differing enzyme
conzentrations before the whole genome duplication (WGD) and parameters
**fV_xxx** that adjust the **Vmax** of the different reactions (xxx eg. HXT or
PYK).  
Figure 3A from the article can be reproduced by changing the value of the
parameters **fV_xxx** to 0.9 indiviually, with xxx signifying the different
enzymes (HXT, HXK ...)  
Figure 3B from the publication can be reproduced by setting the parameter
**WGD_E** to 0.75 and individually setting the parameters **fV_xxx** to 1.333.  
To reproduce figure 2A from the article change the parameter **WGD_E** in the
range between 0.65 and 1.0.
